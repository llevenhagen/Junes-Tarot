  <h2>PRIVATE READINGS</h2>
  <p>Book a private 30 or 60 minute reading or a typed up/emailed reading! Private readings are great for those looking at long-term/deep issues or need guidance on parts of your life that may seem overwhelming or stagnant.</p>
  <p>Expected turnaround times for emailed readings is
  3-7 days after payment receipt.</p>
  <p>Live readings are available in person (San Diego county area
  only) or via video chat, voice chat, or phone. Appointments are available up to 1 month in advance. Appointments are confirmed and in my calendar once I receive payment.</p>
  <p>Regardless of which style of reading you choose, you'll receive a photo and/or list of cards and spread positions, and my undivided attention for our allotted time. If time allows and/or it makes sense for the reading, I may pull one card from an oracle deck.</p>

  <h2>"SHOULD I BOOK A LIVE OR EMAIL READING?"</h2>
  <p>Either allows for introspection and insight into some of the internal and
  external forces surrounding you, but usefulness of each depend on the specificity of the question or whether you need to talk out your issues before I pull the cards.
  </p>
  <p><span class="bold">Live readings</span> (in person, voice or video chat) allow for us to ask each other questions in real time for clarification. </p>
  <p><span class="bold">Emailed readings</span> don't have that easy back-and-forth, but are perfect for the introvert or for those whose scheduling does not allow for live readings. You won't have to frantically scribble notes like you might during a live reading, and you'll be able to refer back to my text again and again.</p>
