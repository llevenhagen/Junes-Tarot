    <h2>PAYMENT METHODS</h2>
    <div class="float-section">
      <p>Here is an alphabetical list of the digital methods that I use to make it easy for you to pay me for services and products. I take cash only for in-person readings.</p>
      <p>I am happy to discuss alternate forms of payment including trade in services or zines, donation to an agreed upon nonprofit/charity, and sliding scale.</p>
      <h4 class=" gold textalign-center">Cash.me/$JuneOwatari <br> PayPal.me/JuneOwatari <br> Venmo.com/June-Owatari <br> Also available: Google Pay</h4>
      <p>I am also open to suggestions!</p>

    <h2>RESCHEDULING, CANCELLATIONS, AND REFUNDS</h2>
    <p class="textalign-center">I totally get it: emergencies and changes in circumstances (and your mind) happen... Hopefully, by having these laid out before you pay prepares you in case you do need to reschedule or cancel! </p>
    <p class="textalign-center">If you have any questions or do need to change/cancel your reading, please send me an email.</p>

   <h2>WALK-IN HOURS / LIBRARY</h2>
   <p class="textalign-center">Come visit me! Not only do I have a tiny (but growing!) zine/book library (mostly) by POC authors and
  focused on magic/witchy/Tarot+ topics, but my walk-in hours allow me to see people who may not be able
  to afford longer/more expensive readings. These shorter walk-in readings are great for those looking to check
  in with themselves or for short-term/temporary issues.</p>
