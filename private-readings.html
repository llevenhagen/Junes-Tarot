      <h2>PRIVATE READINGS</h2>
      <div id="private-readings-p-browser">
      <p>Book a private 30 or 60 minute reading or a typed up/emailed reading! Private readings are great for those looking at long-term/deep issues or need guidance on parts of your life that may seem overwhelming or stagnant.</p>
      <p>Expected turnaround times for emailed readings is
        3-7 days after payment receipt.</p>
      <p>Live readings are available in person (San Diego county area
        only) or via video <br> chat, voice chat, or phone. Appointments are available up to 1 month in advance.<br> Appointments are confirmed and in my calendar once I receive payment.</p>
      <p>Regardless of which style of reading you choose, you'll receive a photo and/or list <br>of cards and spread positions, and my undivided attention for our allotted time. <br>If time allows and/or it makes sense for the reading, I may pull
        one
        card <br>from an oracle deck.</p>
